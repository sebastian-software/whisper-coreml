## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainer directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Security Considerations

### Model Downloads

- Models are downloaded from Hugging Face over HTTPS
- Downloaded files are stored in `~/.cache/whisper-coreml/`
- No authentication tokens are stored or transmitted

### Data Privacy

- All audio processing happens locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- The library works fully offline after model download

### Native Code

- The native addon wraps whisper.cpp, a well-audited open source library
- Source code is available for review in `src/*.cc` and `src/*.h`
- whisper.cpp source is in `vendor/whisper.cpp/`

### Dependencies

- Minimal runtime dependencies
- Native addon is statically linked against whisper.cpp
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
